>How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of dawn!  
>You are cut down to the ground, conqueror of nations!  
>
>And you yourself said in your heart,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ascend to heaven;  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will raise up my throne above the stars of God;  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will sit on the mountain of assembly on the summit of Zaphon;  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ascend to the high places of the clouds,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make myself like the Most High."  
>
>But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit.
